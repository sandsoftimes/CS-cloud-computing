Question #2: CLO-2
Marks: [10] Time: [20 mins]
Suppose you have implemented a dynamic (target tracking scaling) policy and the metric value (CPU utilization) is set to 70% with 4 instances as shown below:
EC2-1 CPU Usage = 60%
EC2-2 CPU Usage = 60%
EC2-3 CPU Usage = 60%
EC2-4 CPU Usage = 60%

a. As per the given CPU utilization what action the autoscaler group would initiate? 
b. How can we identify faulty EC2 instances in autoscaling?
e. What problem you can think of if we set the warm-up time to 0 or 1 sec?

c. Differentiate between round robin, server load, and server connections load balancing strategy. 
d. Discuss the role of Kubernetes in developing large-scale applications.
Le. Comment on the creation of pods using the replica set in achieving reliability.
